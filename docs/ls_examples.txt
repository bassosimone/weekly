Examples:

To see what you have done today in a user friendly format use:

  weekly ls

To fetch the last three days for the `mlab` project in JSON format use:

  weekly ls --project mlab --days 3 --format json

Same as above, but using the CSV format:

  weekly ls --project mlab --days 3 --format csv

Same as above, but generating boxes:

  weekly ls --project mlab --days 3 --format box

You can then aggregate by day as follows:

  weekly ls --project mlab --days 3 --format csv --aggregate daily

Same as above but monthly:

  weekly ls --project mlab --days 60 --format csv --aggregate monthly

You can convert to `invoice` format:

  weekly ls --days 30 --format invoice --aggregate daily

The `invoice` format is a simplified CSV format suitable for generating invoices.
